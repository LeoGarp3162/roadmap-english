English Learning Roadmap

## Phase 1 : Build Confidence

### 1.1. Daily Conversation Sessions 
Start with simple, open-ended questions (e.g., "What’s your favorite hobby?" or "What did you do yesterday?").
Use conversation prompts like “Would you rather” questions or scenarios (e.g., planning a vacation).

### 1.2. "How Do You Say" Practice

Teach members to ask, "How do you say [word/phrase] in English?".   

**Example:**  
A: “I went to... uh, how do you say tempat penjualan makanan di pinggir jalan?”  
B: “Street food market!”


## Phase 2: Build Vocabulary

### 2.1. Board Games with Vocabulary Focus:
Use games like Codenames, Taboo, or Scrabble where participants must read, describe, or create words.

### 2.2. Word Association Challenges:
Start with one word, and members take turns saying related words (e.g., “beach → sand → sun → vacation”).

## Phase 3: Improve Grammar Through Practice

### 3.1. Story Chains

One member starts a story with one sentence. Each person adds a sentence while focusing on correct grammar.

### 3.2. Role-Playing Games

Act out scenarios like ordering at a restaurant, asking for directions, or interviewing for a job. Focus on common sentence structures.
